You are given two strings: fullString and targetString
fullString contains targetString in some way
example: fullString = "1122warhawk3344" and targetString = "warhawk"
For all characters EXCEPTING the targetString, return "+" instead of the character
plustOut(fullString, targetString) returns "++++warhawk++++"
